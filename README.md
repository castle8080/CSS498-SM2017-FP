# Functional Programming Principles and the Application of Statically and Strongly Typed Functional Languages

This project contains the materials, research, code, and reports for an independent studying being done on functional programming for the U.W. Bothell.

## Identify the learning goals/objectives which you want to achieve by the end of contract.

My goal is to learn and demonstrate the application of functional programming concepts. Core concepts should be demonstrated as well as more advanced concepts which show how functional programming techniques are used in other areas of computer science. Haskell will be used as the primary language for exploring concepts, although other functional languages and non-functional languages may be reviewed and used for comparison.

Core Concepts:
* Learn core functional programming principles and techniques including the use of functions as first class citizens, the importance of pure functions, and common high-order functions found in functional languages.
* Learn how to use common immutable data structures, algorithms for immutable data structures, and the performance characteristics of those algorithms including how they compare to similar algorithms using mutation.

Advanced Concepts:
* Learn how to handle concurrency and IO using functional programming techniques.

## Explain why this topic is of interest to you.

Functional programming has a long and rich history in computer science. Lisp, one of the earliest languages created, had functional programming concepts. A large body of research was done on functional programing through the 1960’s and 1970’s. However, as our industry grew through the 1990’s and into the 21st century, object oriented languages seemed to dominate professional software engineering. Over the last decade, our industry has begun to see functional programming concepts pick up. We see many object-oriented languages taking on functional programming concepts.  Both C++ and Java recently added support for first class functions. We are also seeing managed runtimes such as .NET and the JVM have implementations of functional languages such as Clojure, Scala, and F#. The rich background of functional programming and the ability to use functional programming concepts in modern languages in a professional setting is both interesting and pragmatic.

There are several problems found in computer science which can be addressed with functional programming concepts and techniques. Immutability and pure functions can help write highly concurrent programs. Strong static typing combined with pure functions can help reduce logic errors. Large scale data processing concepts such as map reduce are based on functional programming principles. Asynchronous processing libraries can benefit from advanced functional programming concepts. Functional programming serves as a solid base for dealing with many difficult problems we must solve as software engineers.

The Haskell programming language is of interest for a few reasons. The language is relatively strict in how it deals with mutability and it encourages the engineer to deal with programming issues in a functional way. The type system is very advanced compared to other popular languages. There are many tools and libraries for the language which can be used to build “real world” applications, including frameworks for building web services and web applications. There are even tools for converting Haskell to JavaScript to build web user interfaces. The language and tools associated with Haskell will help learn fundamentals while still being potential useful in real world scenarios.
